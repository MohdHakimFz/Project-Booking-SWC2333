# README for RestaurantBooking Project
# Introduction
- The RestaurantBooking project is a Java application designed to facilitate the management of restaurant reservations. This application allows users to connect to a MySQL database to store and retrieve reservation data.

# Prerequisites
Before you can run the RestaurantBooking application, you need to ensure that you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- MySQL Database

# Installation
To set up the RestaurantBooking project, follow these steps:
1. Download the project files from the provided link.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the downloaded files using your file explorer.
3. Extract the contents of the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
4. Inside the extracted files, you will find the database setup code. Copy this code.
5. Open your MySQL Workbench or any MySQL database management tool and execute the copied database setup code to create your database schema.

# Configuration
To configure the application to connect to your MySQL database, you need to:
1. Install JDK and JVM on your system if you haven't already.
2. Place the project files in the appropriate directory within your Java application's workspace.
3. Open the DatabaseConfig.java file (this file name is assumed for illustration purposes) and update the database name and password to match your MySQL Workbench credentials.

# Running the Application
 To run the RestaurantBooking application:
1. Open your Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Navigate to Window > Show View > Other... and search for Data Source Explorer.
3. Click New to create a new database connection and select MySQL as the database type.
4. Enter a name for your database connection and click Next.
5. Provide the actual data for the connection, including the localhost address and password, as per your MySQL setup.
6. Test the connection to ensure that it can successfully connect to your MySQL database.
7. Once the connection is successful, you can run the code from your IDE.
